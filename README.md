Please see my resume below:

[Jordan's resume on google drive.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BetyLvzMyLp5Xc7FEhcQi7GEKdo6pfb3/view)

* This resume mostly concerns artificial intelligence items.

* The resume is actually a collection of (or contains links to) some of my most profound thoughts, including ones about where the human species is reasonably/objectively heading, which happens to be related to artificial intelligence.

* This seeks to exclude opinionated/wishful thinking, and instead, particularly rests strictly upon the scientific method, the only thing that has thus far enabled progress for humanity.
